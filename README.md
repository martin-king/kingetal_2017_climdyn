Some scripts I used for King, Herceg-Bulic, Kucharski, Keenlyside, 2017, Interannual tropical Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies teleconnection to Northern Hemisphere atmosphere in November, Clim Dyn. http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-017-3727-5

Note that although the scripts were used in the research, the versions stored here may have values for some parameters which are not exactly the same as those used in the research.
