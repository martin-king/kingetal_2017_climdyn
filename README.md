Some scripts I used for King, Hell, Keenlyside, 2016, Investigation of the atmospheric mechanisms related to the autumn sea ice and winter circulation link in the Northern Hemisphere, Clim Dyn. http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-017-3727-5

Note that although the scripts were used in the research, the versions stored here may have values for some parameters which are not exactly the same as those used in the research.
